### Hi, I'm Gus

I'm a web developer and designer with a background in theatre (acting, writing, directing). I enjoy tinkering and thinking through software, spelunking through creative computing projects, and researching media and interactions. I love to write beautiful, fast software that is a delight to use.

I'm interested in technology that is truly liberating, soul-expanding art, tools for thought, and software that feels alive.
