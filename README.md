### Hi, I'm Gus ✌🏼

I'm a programmer and designer with a background in theatre and film (acting, writing, directing). I enjoy thinking through interfaces and writing fast, beautiful software that is a delight to use.

I'm interested in technology that is liberating, soul-expanding art, tools for thought and creativity, and software that feels alive.
